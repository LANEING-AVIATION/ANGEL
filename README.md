# Welcome to Angel Applications!

Hello friends on GitHub! I am LANEING AVIATION, the developer of the Angel Applications.

Angel is an Android application that allows you to use touch interactions to import sketch images, create 3D sketches, perform lofting, and carry out other operations. This software enables you to conveniently create 3D paper aircraft models using three-view drawings and can automatically unfold the geometric design and material textures, similar to Pepakura Designer.

Developing Angel software has been a long-time dream of mine. Thanks to the Chinese branch of MIT App Inventor, Wxbit App Inventor, the numerous excellent App Inventor plugins created by various users, and the lightweight, powerful, and easy-to-use 3D graphics library Three.js, my dream has come true. This software was initially completed in the spring of 2022 and has since helped me design numerous airplane models, with continuous improvements and refinements. In the summer of 2023, I introduced many new features to Angel, including a dark interface, and I hope you like them. Of course, if you prefer the previous version, you can still access it.

Angel software has undergone compatibility testing on devices running Android 9/10/12/13/14. Its API level is 29. Due to my limited time, energy, and personal capabilities, I have not been able to perfect this product completely. In the future, I will continue to strive to create more interesting things.
